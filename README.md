 ### House Price Prediction in Bangalore, India

 




## Description

The aim of this project is to bulid a model for predicting the cost of properties in the city of Bangalore, India based on certain features such as area, location, size etc. I have also built a website using HTML, CSS, Javascript for calculating home price.



##  Datasets Used

This dataset is obtained from kaggle and can be downloaded from link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data?resource=download

## Logical Flow of Project

1. Designed a model using sklearn and linear regression using dataset mentioned.

2. Writing a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http get and post requests.

3. Website built in html, css and javascript.

4. This website will allow us to get prices by entering area, location etc by calling python flask server to retrieve predicted price.
